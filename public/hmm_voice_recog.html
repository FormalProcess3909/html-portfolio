    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h2>Markov Chains</h2>
    <p>
      &emsp;Prior to understanding Hidden Markov Models, it is first necessary
      to understand the concept of a Markov Chain. In a Markov Chain there are a
      series of states that can occur, such as determining the temperature
      outside, where the next state is predicted based on the current state. The
      assumption is that none of the previous states will affect the future
      state we would like to predict; only the current state effects the next
      state in the sequence. In the example of outside temperature this can be
      described as predicting tomorrowâ€™s temperature based only on the
      temperature that it is today.
